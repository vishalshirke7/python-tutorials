""" To summarize what you’ve learned so far, here’s an inexhaustive list of the general benefits of using the 
	Python with statement in your code:

1. Makes resource management safer than its equivalent try … finally statements
2. Encapsulates standard uses of try … finally statements in context managers
3. Allows reusing the code that automatically manages the setup and teardown phases of a given operation
4. Helps avoid resource leaks
5. Using the with statement consistently can improve the general quality of your code and make it safer by preventing resource leak problems.
